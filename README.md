- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Supagetti
I'm 29, and am just now learning to code. 
I'm starting with C++. I wanted to pick up a new skill with pratical application. 
I'm not sure if I'd like to get into software development for work, but I like the idea of building an indi game in my spare time. 

I'm using my account for two reasons for the time being: 
1. to learn how to use github
2. to store my learning projects to look back on later 

Nothing of value will really be found here.
